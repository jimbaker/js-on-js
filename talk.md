# Overview


# Credits!

* JavaScript interpreter, written for labs developed by Evan Chang at Univ of Colorado, Boulder
  - Judgment forms to define operational semantics
  - Expressed on Scala
* Modified for this talk to be in terms of unit tests and JavaScript

* Sandboxing with [JS in JS](https://sns.cs.princeton.edu/2012/04/javascript-in-javascript-js-js-sandboxing-third-party-scripts/)
* PyPy - Python on Python - used to be 1000x slower, now it can be 20x faster (FIXME check stats)
* Self-hosting compilers - GNU C, javac (but Hotspot JVM uses C++ at its core), ...
* FIXME other similar projects; Ouroboros FIXME maybe a picture element here; maybe this could be good for 

# Syntax

# Semantics

# Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)

FIXME - something simple like math

FIXME ASTs look like the document object model (DOM), but for the program/script itself

# Recursion


# ASTs in JavaScript

* How to produce
* What do they mean?

# Use Esprima

```javascript
const esprima = require('esprima')
```

* Note the use of `const` - we are using EcmaScript 6!
* Can still override in the console (FIXME can we require let/const/var?)

# AST of an expression

The body of a program is a sequence of statements:

```
> esprima.parse('6 * 7')
{ type: 'Program',
  body: [ { type: 'ExpressionStatement', expression: [Object] } ],
  sourceType: 'script' }
```

NB: the program is captured! so you have to cut things out

# Use `JSON.stringify`

```
console.log(JSON.stringify(esprima.parse('6*7'), null, '  '))
```

# Complete AST

```
> console.log(JSON.stringify(esprima.parse('6*7'), null, '  '))
{
  "type": "Program",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "ExpressionStatement",
      "expression": {
        "type": "BinaryExpression",
        "operator": "*",
        "left": {
          "type": "Literal",
          "value": 6,
          "raw": "6"
        },
        "right": {
          "type": "Literal",
          "value": 7,
          "raw": "7"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "sourceType": "script"
}
```

# AST of an anonymous function being defined

# Why anonymous functions in JS?

FIXME describe how they rock

# AST combined

A simple function:

```
(function(x) { return x * 7 })(6)
```

# Parsing

Parsed:

```
x = esprima.parse('(function(x) { return x * 7 })(6)')
```

# What are functions anyway?

FIXME (encapsulated code that be executed repeatedly; may be named, or just have a reference)

# Built-in `eval` function

```
> eval('6 * 7')
42
```

# More complex usage

```
> eval('(function(x) { return x * 7 })(6)')
42
```

# Why do we need `eval`?

# When should we not use `eval`?

Cross-site scripting) (XSS) attacks!

# Writing our own `eval` function

> ast.body[0].expression
{ type: 'BinaryExpression',
  operator: '*',
  left: { type: 'Literal', value: 6, raw: '6' },
  right: { type: 'Literal', value: 7, raw: '7' } }
> function myeval(expr) { if (expr.operator === '*') { return expr.left.value * expr.right.value } }
undefined
> eval(ast.body[0].expression)
42

# Interpreter

Proceed by rewriting AST to another AST - presumably simpler! FIXME

# Operational semantics

We are going to choose big-step for simplicity, but small-step allows
us to describe precisely each execution step as a reduction:

* Big step semantics
* Small step semantics

# Judgment form

# Equivalent test

# Testing frameworks in JavaScript

* choice of assertions
* test discovery

# FIXME specific tool to be used in JS

# Test-driven development

* Start with our tests first
* Build corresponding functionality
* Repeat until done

# Test-driven development

=> Requirements driven, but concrete - based on actual needs

# Syntax testing?

Not today - we already have a parser, let's move on

# Semantics tests

* What is our core functionality?

Name bindings, expression evaluation

Can simplify further these ideas... But this is not a theory course condensed into one hour...

# GitHub and tracking commits

FIXME do this? or just demo away?
