An implementation of JavaScript on JavaScript, as presented to the
[Boulder JavaScript meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Boulder-JS/) on
[November 18, 2015](http://www.meetup.com/Boulder-JS/events/226663066/). This
is a toy interpreter, meant to show how easy it can be to write an
interpreter.

The corresponding example code is in ECMAScript 2015, and has been tested on Node 5.

Uses the following packages:

* Esprima for parsing JavaScript to abstract syntax trees
* Chai, for assertions
* Mocha, for test discovery and running

The talk can be found in [Markdown](talk.md) and [PDF](talk.pdf). One
of these days, maybe even in a JS deck as well!
